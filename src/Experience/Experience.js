            <li>Server
                <p>For six years, I have been a server at Texas Roadhouse. There, I learned how to perform
                    quality and sufficent customer service in a fast paced environment. Also, as both a supply
                    manager and a trainer, I developed leadership and mentorship skills, to both welcome and
                    teach new uncoming employees. Both of these roles were choices that I made, and were not required
                    from me. I have an innate desire to better the workplace, create connections, and make sure everyone
                    feels welcome and accepted.</p>

                        Front End Development at Turing
                        <p>At Turing School of Software and Design, I went through their front end
                            development course. I have done group, solo and partner projects, and completed  18
                            front end programming projects, all using JavaScript. During that course, I learned JavaScript,
                            HTML, CSS3, React,  and Typescript as my techstacks. I also have some experience
                            using GraphQL.

                    <li>Catalyte
                        <p>At Catalyte, I was learned to be both front and a backend devloper. I completed 3 projects ,
                            and each project I used a different programming language. First was Javascript, then Java, and finally
                            I learned a bit of SQL as well.
