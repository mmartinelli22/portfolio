                <li>Gym</li>
                <p>Going to the gym is a huge part of my life.
                    It helps me keep my mind away from day to day activites, and is a place where I can constantly
                    better myself, and take a break from day to day activites. I lift weights, and have
                    been practicing Muay Thai, a combat sport originated in Thailand.
                </p>
                <li>Games</li>
                <p>I'm a huge gamer! League, World of Warcraft, Elden Ring, these are some of my favorite games to play.
                    I also frequent playing Magic the Gathering.
                </p>
                <li>Entertainment</li>
                <p>There's a lot of tv shows I like. I range from anime to tv drama like Breaking Bad.
                    My personal favorite piece of entertainment is Berserk, a japenese graphic novel and
                    anime.
